# Classify Identification with Machine Learning
This is a repository for the paper "Cross-device radio frequency fingerprinting identiffcation based on domain adaptation"（https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377670664_Cross-Device_Radio_Frequency_Fingerprinting_Identification_Based_On_Domain_Adaptation）
A cross-device classify identification scheme which motivated by the observation that signals collected by different receiver devices have a distribution shift that would violate the basic independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) assumption of supervised learning. Domain adaptation is adopted to improve the accuracy under different receivers, which can align the data captured from different devices and eliminate the distribution shift through the labeled data from one receiver device and unlabeled data from the other device.
